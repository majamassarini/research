## Onboarded without Copr builds

- nss-pem

## Blocked

### Package not found

- cockpit-container
- redminecli

### Upstream not found

- anaconda-user-help

### Source in pagure

- standard-test-roles

### multiple sources or patches in spec

- avahi
- jzlib
- ksh
- libvncserver
- openscap
- pykickstart - has invalid packit.yml right now (spec.in in specfile path)
- python-requests
- rust-pretty-git-prompt - has packit config
- system-config-printer
- yp-tools

## Needs action for spec generate

- anaconda - how is it built?
- abrt (onboarding blocked by pending build system change)
- libreport (onboarding blocked by pending build system change)
- cockpit - spec parse fails
- cockpit-composer - npm fails
- rpminspect - instructions for creating .spec?
- satyr (onboarding blocked by pending build system change)

## Other error

- expat - unclosed macro or bad line continuation
- javapackages-tools - unclosed macro or bad line continuation
- gperftools - Failed to parse SPEC file
- abrt-java-connector - The target archive doesn't use a common extension
- libevent - The target archive doesn't use a common extension

## Rejected

- python-requests-file
  - increased maintanance cost by having .packit.yml file in repo

  - automation for Fedora and COPR should not depend on upstream changes
    or carrying your config file in our repositories.
  - More info: https://github.com/weldr/lorax/pull/878
- checkpolicy - https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/pull/186
  - related also to **libsepol, libselinux, libsemanage, policycoreutils, secilc, mcstrans**
  - multiple components and multiple tarballs from one repository
  - the packages from the repo depend on each other (have to be taken care of/built in a specific order)
  - changes have potential to be accepted only on fedora fork
    https://github.com/fedora-selinux/selinux, changes on
    upstream need to be approved via mailing list
  - lack of trust caused by failed cooperation with other always ready project
- libguestfs collection of tools:
  - The project is using mailing lists for reviews, not GitHub pull requests
  - The request from them is that packit-service would react to branch pushes instead of PR changes
    - https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/issues/239
  - libnbd is able to be onboarded: https://github.com/TomasTomecek/libnbd/pull/1
- Red Hat infra services team & github.com/redhat-performance
  - Some of the projects are on-board.
  - Problems:
    - ["Only collaborators can trigger packit."](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/issues/606)
    - ["More verbose packit service."](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/issues/243)
    - ["New Fedora release should not require projects to change packit.yaml"](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/issues/540)
- Open Source projects from [David Cantrell](https://github.com/dcantrell)
  - [Packit should take care of the complete upstream release process](https://github.com/dcantrell/pyparted/pull/66#issuecomment-555038520):
    - Create tarball, sign it and upload
  - Push to Fedora iff all CI tests pass for the respective tag.
  - Handle %changelog.
- dnf
  - cross-PR dependencies
    - short-term solution: enable adding a repository to the copr project via a PR comment
    - create SRPM from master branch of a dependency, if no dependency is specified
    - are using packit: 50 % of builds fail b/c of dependant projects & pull requests
  - they use a dedicated repo for tests
  - Current CI solution:
    - provisioning: container image: contains rpm builds of all the components with tests included
    - the container image is the input for the testing phase
    - they want to have a matrix with all the test cases: distribute the runs to the testing farm
  - another complete run should be then preformed with all packages built like if the PRs were merged
- Dusty & CoreOS
  - synced_files: src/ dest/ confusion
  - naming: source-git, propose-update
  - docs, source-git: finish the guide, show packit.yml
  - source-git patches: some files are not excluded (packit.yaml, spec file, downstream files) - configurable?
  - having packit.yaml in dist-git is confusing: we could have a "link" in dist-git which would point to a real location
  - validate packit yaml and halt if it's invalid
  - operate on a copy of a git repo: configurable?
  - trigger: new commit in a branch, action: build in a koji tag (and push to a d-g branch)
  - end goal: build certain upstream projects in a tag, release the tag to a stream & ostree repo
    - they want to use real koji builds - being able to yum install from a koji tag
    - push to a dedicated dist-git branch?
  - 5-10 projects
  - talk to Christian G
