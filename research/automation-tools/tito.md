## Usecases

### [Tagging](https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito#tagging-packages)

Tag new releases with incremented RPM version or release.

1. bump the version/release in spec file
2. auto-generate spec file changelog based on git history since last tag
3. commit changes
4. git tag

### [Building](https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito#custom-builders--taggers--releasers)

- Create reliable tar.gz files with consistent checksums from any tag.
- Build source and binary rpms off any tag.

  ```
  $ tito build --help
  Usage: tito build [options]

  Options:
    --tgz                 Build .tar.gz
    --srpm                Build srpm
    --rpm                 Build rpm
    :
  ```

- Build source and binary "test" rpms off most recently committed code.
  ```
  tito build --test
  ```
- Build multiple source rpms with appropriate disttags for submission to the Koji build system.

- Build packages off an "upstream" git repository, where modifications in the "downstream" git repository will be applied as a patch in the source rpm. ([UpstreamBuilder](https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito/blob/0942baa1217ad31cd5c4cbb8750de3db15410672/src/tito/builder/main.py#L701))
- Manage all of the above for a git repository with many disjoint packages within it.

### Releases
