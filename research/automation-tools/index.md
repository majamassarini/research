There are multiple tools with the similar goal to Packit. Here is a list of tools that are similar, related or can be potentially used for some subtasks:

- [tito](automation-tools/tito)
- [rdopkg](automation-tools/rdopkg)
- [rpkg](automation-tools/rpkg) + [rpkg2](automation-tools/rpkg#RPKG2)
- [rpkg-util](automation-tools/rpkg-util)
- [dlrn](automation-tools/dlrn)

[Here](https://pagure.io/rpkg/issue/49) is a discussions about creating a new rpkg, that would be the on, and only one packaging framework and library. ([rpkg2](automation-tools/rpkg#RPKG2) is the follow-up from that discussion.)
