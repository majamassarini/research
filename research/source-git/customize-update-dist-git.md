title: Customizing 'source-git update-dist-git'
authors: csomh

Starting question: How do we transform an upstream repository to dist-git?
What are the steps that are required, and what actions or transformations
happen along the way?

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  git(Git) -- git format-patch --> patches(Patches)
  git -- git archive --> archive(Source archive)
  git -- make archive --> archive
  git -- copy other files --> dist_git
  rp(Official release page) -- download --> archive
  patches --> bundle
  archive --> bundle{"."}
  srpm(SRPM) -- unpack --> dist_git(Dist-git)
  spec(Specfile) --> bundle
  bundle -- build --> srpm
  patches -- update --> spec
  archive -- update --> spec
  version(Version) -- update --> spec
  release(Release) -- update --> spec
  style git fill:red,color:white
```

In the flowchart above the transformation process includes building and then
unpacking an SRPM. This step serves as a (partial) validation of the integrity
of the content to be committed to dist-git, and it is inspired from the
[Kernel source-git workflow].

In order to build an SRPM 3 things need to be configurable:

1. How the source archive is created.
2. How patches are produced from the Git-history.
3. The way the spec-file is generated or updated.

Packit already has actions for all three of these, and all these actions run
as part of `packit srpm`. To make the three aspects above configurable,
`source-git update-dist-git` could be updated to run `packit srpm` under the
hood, and use the unpacked SRPM to update dist-git.

The functionality provided by `files_to_sync` wouldn't be changed:
additionally to unpacking the SRPM to dist-git, `update-dist-git` should also
consider syncing the content specified by `files_to_sync`.

Besides this the following improvements could be made:

## Improvements to 'create-archive'

Currently `create-archive` takes a command or a list of commands which are
executed in a non-shell environment. There is also the top-level `sources`
key, which has a similar role to `create-archive`, but instead of running some
commands, it will download and save the archive.

These two could be merged, by allowing `create-archive` to also be a
dictionary, and introducing two new configuration sub-keys: `download` and
`script`.

`create-archive.script` would take a single or multi-line string and run it as
a bash script. This behavior is similar how multi-line scripts are handled in
GitHub or GitLab workflows.

`create-archive.download` would be synonymous to `sources`.

Examples:

```yaml
actions:
  create-archive:
    download:
      - url: https://my_website.com/
        path: name
```

```yaml
actions:
  create-archive:
    script: |
      rm *.tar.gz
      make archive
```

## Improvements to 'create-patches'

`create-patches` currently expects a command or a list of commands. The
`script` subkey could be introduced here, too, in order to make the
configuration syntax similar to `create-archive`. Other subkeys could be
introduced later on, to provide some pre-defined (but still configurable) ways
to generate patches.

Currently there is no mechanism to pass the patches produced by this action to
`fix-spec-file`.

## Improvements to 'fix-spec-file'

`fix-spec-file` currently expects a command or a list of commands. Similarly
to the previous two changes, `script` could be introduced, to be consistent
with the other three.

## Stories proposed

- Introduce a `script` key for all actions. This key would be a single or
  multi-line string which is going to be executed as a bash script.
  (packit/packit#1641)
- Introduce `create-archive.download` to be a synonym for `sources`. Mark
  `sources` as deprecated. (packit/packit#1642)
- Update `source-git update-dist-git` to use `packit srpm` under the hood,
  unpacking the SRPM to dist-git. (packit/packit#1643)
- Provide patches produced by `create-patches` for `fix-spec-file`.
  (packit/packit#1644)
