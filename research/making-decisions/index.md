We'd like to have a predictable way of making decisions so that we are not
blocked on picking vim over emacs. I mean solution A over solution B.

## [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/blob/master/ODF-community.md)

This is the Red Hat's framework for making open, transparent and democratic
decisions in organizations.

We can use it for making large-scale decisions which affect multiple
stakeholders and where implementation would take a considerable effort.
Although that's not what we need here, we need to be able to make quick
democratic decisions within one sprint.

I am amazed that the framework champions these type of questions and
suggestions which can help us decide:

- Whose problem are we trying to solve?
- Who else could be impacted?
- Who has solved a similar problem?
- Who is likely to disagree, dissent, reject, or opt out? Who else may care?
- Gather input from internal customers and those who you will need help from (surveys, interviews, focus groups, etc.)
- Remain open to new information and perspectives
- Consider peer-to-peer feedback and communication options in addition to formal channels
- How will we monitor mailing lists and other feedback channels after the launch?
- How willing are we to make revisions based on feedback?
- What's a reasonable window of time for additional input and refinement?
- Did we overlook something important? How do we address it?

## [FESCo](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/)

Decisions in FESCo are the daily bread so we can get an inspiration here. They
have a well-thought voting mechanism:

- One week for FESCo members to vote `+1` or `-1`. After the period accept if 3
  `+1`s were received without a negative vote and vice versa.

- Immediately accept or reject when getting 7 votes of the same type.

- After a week, discuss the topic and decide.

This also sounds like a too complicated solution for us although I like the
aspect of: discuss when unsure, accept/reject in agreement.

## [UK Government suggestion for voting in charities](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/charity-meetings-making-decisions-and-voting#follow-voting-rules-if-applicable)

Simple and clear: members cast votes on meetings :) just like we do with grooming.

## ["Board Voting: Common Steps & Tips for Better Decision-Making"](https://boardable.com/blog/board-voting/)

Interesting (and biased) blog post which describes in detail the process of
voting in non-profit organizations.

## [Franta's suggestion about decision making in Teal organizations](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/theory/decision-making/)

A thorough and well-explained comparison between types of organization and the
decision making process followed by a fascinating read about the Teal decision
making.

Funnily enough, the advice the article is giving is contrary to my current
proposal ('duh). They advise for the decision maker to make a call based on
research, advices and being the subject matter expert. I instead suggested to
have a consensus on a decision. The argument from the article is that reaching
consensus is too expensive time-wise and resource-wise. I'd still try what I
propose and reevaluate what's the most optimal process for us after a period of
time.

We can definitely still learn from the article so I strongly suggest reading it.

## [Consent Decision Making](https://thedecider.app/consent-decision-making)

**winner**

Another fascinating process to make decisions with a clear process how to reach
decisions.

## [CKI's feedback mechanism](https://cki-project.org/docs/hacking/rfcs/cki-001-cki-feedback-mechanism/)

CKI team uses the _Request For Comments_ mechanism to formally propose a change
so the team can provide feedback without requiring eventual consensus.

## [Democracy 2.1](https://vitalplus.org/demokracie-2-1-rozhodovat-jinak-a-lepe/)

A new way of voting proposal created by a Czech mathematician which enables
people to cast +2 and -1 votes. The pitch is that it would eliminate "the bad
guys" getting to parliament.

## Proposal

- Use the Consent Decision Making process since it leaves plenty of room for a
  discussion and addressing objections.

- The owner of a topic is empowered to make a decision while being supported by
  the team.

- If we are still unable to make a decision, we can use a voting mechanism
  (e.g. the Democracy 2.1 scheme).

- Reevaluate after a few sprints pass.
